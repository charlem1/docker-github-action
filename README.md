# docker-github-action

In this project task, we are assigned to automate Docker Deployment with GitHub tasks. This project required the use of GitHub, GitHub Workflow to push an image onto Dockerhub that can, in turn, run on anyone's PC or laptop provided they have a terminal to 
utilize. The user can also optionally use Visual Studio Code to get some tasks done.

# GitHub Usage

Using GitHub, the user is to commit code onto the service using Visual Studio Code or the Workflow on its own. The initial code was taken from Dr. Sharma's Foosball website. A user would download the Foosball code, and then upload a copy of that code into their own repository with their own credentials. Finally, the user would commit and push the code onto GitHub but not before setting up Dockerhub

#Docker Usage

Docker is an umbrella term used for Docker's software. Docker Desktop, which can be installed onto the user's PC or laptop and Dockerhub which is the online client of the software also needed to create the website. Before anything, the user would create a Docker account on the website, and generate a personal token to use with GitHub. The user would input their Docker username as well as the special password given from Docker. After doing that, and following the other directions in the GitHub usage, the user would finally pull their new docker image to the system. This requires inputting the same username and token previously given. The user would put the link into a url on a browser, and a foosball website should appear.
